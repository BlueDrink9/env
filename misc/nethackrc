# over. It contains a view of the map and a record of the
# player's belonging, attributes, etc.
#
# dumpfile: The path and name of the file where the log is
# written. If a relative path is specified it is relative
# to the game's data directory. Normally
# /sdcard/Android/data/com.tbd.UnNetHack
# The macros %n and %d can be used. %n is replaced by the
# character's name and %d is replaced by the current date.
#
# dumpfile_format: the format of the log. It can be html,
# text, or both. ".html" or ".txt" is appended to the
